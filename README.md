Intro

ZahniHero is an interactive toothbrushing assistant designed specifically for children, to motivate them to brush their teeth for up to 3 minutes. As soon as brushing begins, ZahniHero uses sound or vibration sensors to detect activity and activates colorful LED animations: blue after 1 minute, flashing white after 2 minutes, and a rainbow light after 3 minutes. The goal is to make brushing fun and to encourage healthy, consistent habits.

In addition to the physical device, the companion website https://zahnihero.yiyun.me/ offers a digital extension. Here, parents and dentists can view brushing history and duration through visual dashboards, providing additional guidance. The site is connected to our Supabase database, which collects real-time brushing data from each device.

ZahniHero – for better brushing routines, powered by play and supported by data — without screens. Unlike other products on the market that rely on an additional tablet to entertain children during brushing, ZahniHero keeps the experience simple, focused, and engaging.
